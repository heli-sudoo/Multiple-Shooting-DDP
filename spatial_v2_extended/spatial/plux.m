function  [o1,o2] = plux( i1, i2 )

% plux  compose/decompose Plucker coordinate transform.
% X=plux(E,r) and [E,r]=plux(X)  compose a Plucker coordinate transform X
% from its component parts E and r, and decompose it into those parts,
% respectively.  E is a 3x3 rotational coordinate transform and r is a 3D
% vector.  r is returned as a column vector, but it can be supplied as a
% row or column vector.  X is a coordinate transform corresponding to a
% shift of origin by an amount specified by r, followed by a rotation about
% the new origin as specified by E.  For example, plux(rx(1),[2 3 4]) makes
% the same transform as rotx(1)*xlt([2 3 4]).  If two arguments are
% supplied then they are assumed to be E and r, otherwise X.
